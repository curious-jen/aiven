1. **Create a Kafka Service in Aiven:**
 - Log in to your Aiven account.
 - Go to the dashboard or services section.
 - Click on "Create a new service."
 - Choose Kafka from the list of available services.
 - Configure the Kafka service according to your requirements, such as the cloud provider, region, plan, etc.
 - Review the configuration and confirm the creation of the Kafka service.
 - Once the service is provisioned, you'll receive connection information such as the Kafka broker URL, username, password, and other necessary details.
2. **Produce JSON Data to a Kafka Topic:**
    - Use [demo.py](https://github.com/curious-jen/aiven/blob/main/python/demo.py) as the example code snippet in Python using the confluent_kafka library to produce JSON data to a Kafka topic.
    - Replace `<KAFKA_BROKER_URL>`, `<KAFKA_USERNAME>`, `<KAFKA_PASSWORD>`, and `<YOUR_TOPIC_NAME>` with the respective values provided by Aiven for your Kafka service.
3. **Run the Code:** Execute the Python script to produce JSON data to the Kafka topic specified.
4. **Verify Data:** You can verify that data is successfully produced to the Kafka topic by consuming from it using a Kafka consumer or checking the topic details in the Aiven dashboard.
Make sure to install the `confluent_kafka` library using `pip install confluent_kafka` before running the Python script. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary SSL certificates and authentication credentials configured correctly in your Kafka produc
